Preview release.

Embeds FIMK 0.5.1 and NXT-PLUS based on NXT 1.5.13.

Did a major refactoring of the initial gossip client code. Reason being that 
we are in need of adding support for more message types.

Improvements to the chat section, no longer does the online/offline status
of contacts 'flicker' when coming and going online.

Added support to see if a contact successfully received a message.
Added support to see that a contact "starts typing".

Did away with the Send button in the chat section. Send button still available
but only on mobile on large screens you must hit the ENTER key to send the 
message. Use SHIFT+ENTER to add a new line.
