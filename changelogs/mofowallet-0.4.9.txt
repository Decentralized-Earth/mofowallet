Preview release.

Embeds FIMK 0.5.1 and NXT-PLUS based on NXT 1.5.13.

Create an about dialog, accessible from the settings menu. This dialog
displays the client version and build time and the server version when
running the embedded server.

Fixed the balance display for the logged in user, this balance now 
updates in real-time the moment you send or receive any type of transaction.

The build scripts now add the build time to the global auto-generated mode.js
settings file.
