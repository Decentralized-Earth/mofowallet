Preview release.

Embeds FIMK 0.5.1 and NXT-PLUS based on NXT 1.5.13.

Added about dialog, accessible from the settings menu. The dialog
displays the client version and build time and the server version when
running the embedded server.

Fixed the balance display for the logged in user in the top bar, balance now 
updates in real-time when you send or receive any type of transaction.

The build scripts now add the build time to the global auto-generated mode.js
settings file.

Changed the price chart to use the new server chart backend. This fixes 
the pricechart bugs for low volume assets. Chart now has access to proper 
OHLC data.
